Sirenum Scopuli-an interactive installation based on the mythical creature, the Siren
Theme

The project is an interactive installation that produces audio results in real time. the theme is based on sirens, a gorgonoid race living in the islands sirenum scopuli as described in homer's odyssey. I am trying to achieve a fiction story of ulysses adventure with the sirens implemented in the project itself.
